# Project 1 - Refactoring

This project is a refactoring exercise:

## v1
Is a pretty unorganized code, that we received to refactor, trying to identify the smells, and of course, first creating tests to make a safe refactoring session.

## v2
The first refactor, pretty aligned with clean code principles, extracting functions, naming variables, early returning, etc (see `smells.md` from item 1 to 9).

## v3
Introducing OOP, creating entities able to be reused and abstracted easily into code.
